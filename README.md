# PyTorch Practical Approach

This repository serves as a practical guide to learning ***PyTorch***, a popular open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph, making it ideal for research and production alike. This README file outlines the basic concepts of PyTorch, introduces fundamental machine learning concepts, and explains how this repository can be used to dive into PyTorch through hands-on exercises using Python.
Moreover, PyTorch offers dynamic computation graphs, allowing for more flexibility in building and modifying models compared to static graph libraries like TensorFlow.
