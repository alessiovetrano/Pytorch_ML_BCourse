    "# Automatic Differentiation with torch.autograd\n",
    "\n",
    "When training neural networks, the most frequently used algorithm is backpropagation. This algorithm involves adjusting parameters (model weights) based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. In PyTorch, this process is facilitated by its built-in differentiation engine called torch.autograd, which enables automatic computation of gradients for any computational graph and offers a methods to solve the *derivates* and in particular the *gradients*.\n",
    "In backpropagation, the algorithm works by first forward-propagating input data through the neural network to compute the predicted output. Then, it calculates the loss between the predicted output and the actual target output. Afterward, it computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter of the network using the chain rule of calculus, propagating the gradients backward through the network. Finally, it updates the parameters using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the loss and improve the model's performance."
